# My Personal Compass

We usually have different interests in our lives and this application allows you to quickly explore which of them you have around and discover them.
This application allows users to quickly find interests close to them, without having to search one by one and allows users to establish a navigation route to the desired destination.

## Implementation


In the first view "My interests" you can keep a list of your interests. 
You can enter the keyword that interests to you and adds it to the list of interests by entering your text in the text fill at the bottom of the screen. 
If you need to delete one of the items slide your finger to the left over one of them and the button delete will allow you to erase that content. 
In the right corner of each item, a check mark indicates if that keyword is going to be active. Clicking on in you can activate or deactivate that keyword.


In the second view "My Compass", clicking on the "Discover interests around me" button, we display places associated with your interests according to your interests list in the current location. 
 By click in one of them, you can establish the route to reach the place of interest.
